1,Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas to create a DataFrame.,Ensures the data is properly structured for further processing.,2,1
2,"Separated the features (X) and the target variable (y). The features include all columns except for the target, which is ""custcat"".",Prepares the dataset for model training by distinguishing independent and dependent variables.,2,2
3,Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.,Ensures that the model is trained on one part of the data and evaluated on another to test its generalization ability.,3,2
4,Scaled the features using StandardScaler() to normalize them.,"Standardization ensures that all features contribute equally to the model, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms like KNN.",3,3
5,Trained the KNN classifier with an initial value of k=2 and used it to predict the target values on the test set.,Provides a starting point for evaluating the classifier’s performance.,3,3
6,"Used a loop to evaluate the KNN model with various values of k (from 1 to 99), calculating the accuracy for each k and storing the results in a list.",Finds the most optimal k for better performance.,5,4
7,"Identified the optimal k by finding the index of the highest accuracy score using np.argmax(), and extracted the best accuracy value.",Ensures the selection of the best hyperparameter for the model.,3,3
8,Plotted the accuracy scores against k values to visualize how accuracy changes with different k values.,Provides a clear visualization of the impact of k on accuracy.,10,4
9,Added a vertical red line to mark the optimal k.,Helps easily identify the best k in the plot.,2,2
10,Printed the optimal value of k and the highest accuracy achieved.,Displays the best configuration for model tuning as the final output.,2,2
