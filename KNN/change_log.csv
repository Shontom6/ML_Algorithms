1,Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas to create a DataFrame.
2,"Separated the features (X) and the target variable (y). The features include all columns except for the target  which is ""custcat""."
3,Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to train the model on one part and test its generalization ability on another.
4,Scaled the features using StandardScaler() to normalize them  ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model  which is important for distance-based algorithms like KNN.
5,Trained the KNN classifier with an initial value of k=2 and used it to predict the target values on the test set.
6,Used a loop to evaluate the KNN model with various values of k (from 1 to 99)  calculating the accuracy for each k and storing the results in a list.
7,Identified the optimal k by finding the index of the highest accuracy score using np.argmax()  and extracted the best accuracy value.
8,Plotted the accuracy scores against k values to visualize how accuracy changes with different k values. Added a vertical red line to mark the optimal k.
9,Printed the optimal value of k and the highest accuracy achieved as the final output.
