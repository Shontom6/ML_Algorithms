Change,Reason for Change,Estimated Time (mins),Difficulty (1-10)
Changed dataset from iris.csv to Naive-Bayes-Classification-Data.csv,The new dataset focuses on predicting diabetes instead of classifying flowers.,15,2
"Removed unnecessary imports (numpy, mpimg, %matplotlib inline)","These are not required for this task, simplifying the code.",1,1
Removed image visualization (plt.imshow(img)),"The new dataset does not involve images, making this step unnecessary.",1,1
Changed target variable from species to diabetes,"Adjusted for the new dataset, making it more relevant.",10,5
Removed manual accuracy calculation from confusion matrix,"Used accuracy_score() from sklearn.metrics, which is a standard approach.",2,3
Replaced confusion matrix visualization with a feature correlation heatmap,A correlation heatmap helps understand feature relationships better.,7,6
Added df.corr() to analyze feature relationships,Helps in understanding how features influence the target variable.,5,4
Added print() statements to display actual and predicted values,Makes it easier to check the accuracy of  model output.,2,2
