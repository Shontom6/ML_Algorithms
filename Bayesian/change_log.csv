Using 01_Naiye Bayes classification.ipynb as reference the data was loaded into the dataframe
checked the accuracy without making any changes and it gave an accuracy of 0.94
for checking the removed the scaling of data and got an accuracy of 0.92
checked mutliple times with scaling and without scaling and the accuracy was high with scaling
As the accuracyis high checked the data in test data and predicted data
