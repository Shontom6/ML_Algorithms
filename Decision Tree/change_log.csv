Change,Reason for Change,Estimated Time (mins),Difficulty (1-10)
Changed dataset from titanic.csv to diabetes_dataset.csv,"The new dataset is related to diabetes classification instead of passenger data, making it more relevant for the task.",12,3
"Removed unused columns (PassengerId, Name, etc.) from the Titanic dataset","The new dataset has different features, so these columns are no longer relevant.",2,4
Removed data cleaning steps like handling NaN values,"The diabetes dataset does not have NaN values, so the cleaning step was unnecessary.",3,3
Removed encoding of categorical variables (Sex column),"The diabetes dataset only contains numerical values, so encoding is not needed.",1,2
Removed splitting features and target variables using np.split(),"Used a simpler method (df.drop() and df[""Outcome""]) for splitting the features and targets.",10,5
Removed unnecessary conversion of target values to integers,"The target values in the diabetes dataset are already integers, so conversion was not needed.",4,2
Added feature correlation heatmap visualization,"Included a heatmap to help visually analyze the correlations between features, which is helpful for beginners.",13,4
