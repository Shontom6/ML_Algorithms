No.,Change Description,Reason for Change,Time Taken,Difficulty (1-10)
1,"Imported necessary libraries including numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, and pickle.","To have essential tools for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.",10,2
2,Loaded the dataset winequality-white.csv using pandas.read_csv().,To read the data for analysis and model training.,5,1
3,Initialized RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble.,To create a machine learning model for regression.,8,3
4,Separated features and target variable using drop and indexing.,To prepare data for model training and prediction.,3,3
5,Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split().,To evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.,5,3
6,"Trained the model using reg.fit(X_train, y_train).",To fit the model on training data.,8,4
7,Predicted target values using reg.predict(X_test).,To generate predictions on the test data.,6,2
8,Converted the predicted values to integers using np.round() and astype(int).,To match the integer nature of quality ratings.,10,2
9,Calculated model accuracy using accuracy_score() and printed the result.,To evaluate the model's performance.,12,2
10,Visualized feature importance using a bar plot with matplotlib.,To understand the most significant features.,8,5
11,Generated a heatmap of feature correlations using seaborn and matplotlib.,To identify relationships between features.,10,5
12,Saved the trained model to a file using pickle.dump().,To persist the model for future use.,5,2
