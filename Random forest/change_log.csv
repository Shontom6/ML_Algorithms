No.,Change,Reason for Change,Estimated Time (mins),Difficulty (1-10)
1,"data = skd.load_boston() changed to pd.read_csv(""winequality-white.csv"").",The original method was causing errors because sklearn.datasets.load_boston() is deprecated. Used pandas.read_csv() to load a custom dataset.,3,3
2,Checked for Null values and found 1 in Gender and 3 in Speed_of_Impact.,Null values were checked in the dataset to ensure completeness before training the model.,3,2
3,Calculated the mean of Speed_of_Impact and filled missing values.,Missing values in Speed_of_Impact were handled by filling with the mean to avoid errors in model training.,4,3
4,Dropped rows with missing Gender values.,Rows with missing Gender values were dropped to ensure data consistency.,4,3
5,Used train_test_split() for splitting data into train and test sets.,train_test_split() was used to split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for better model evaluation.,4,3
6,Converted y_pred to integers using np.round() to fix float-integer type mismatch between y_test and y_pred.,The type mismatch error between y_test (int) and y_pred (float) was resolved by rounding y_pred to integers.,4,3
7,"Used LabelEncoder() to convert categorical values (Gender, Helmet_Used, Seatbelt_Used) into binary.","Categorical features like Gender, Helmet_Used, and Seatbelt_Used were encoded as binary values to enable model training.",5,4
8,Plotted feature importances using feature_importances_.,Visualized the importance of each feature for predicting the target variable to improve model interpretability.,6,4
9,Checked model accuracy using accuracy_score() after predictions.,Accuracy was calculated and printed to evaluate model performance on the test set.,3,3
10,Visualized feature correlation using a heatmap (sns.heatmap()).,Correlation heatmap was plotted to understand the relationships between features in the dataset.,5,3
11,Removed unused imports.,"Cleaned up the code by removing unnecessary imports (tree, etc.), improving readability and efficiency.",3,2
12,Used Altair for additional correlation analysis (alternative method).,Altair was used to analyze and visualize correlations as a complement to the heatmap.,5,4
