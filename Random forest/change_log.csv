1,data = skd.load_boston()  changed as it was showing error to pandas read_csv
2,Using Altair software found the correlation of the data
3,In the jupyter file it was didvoed into train and test data so used train_test_split to divide the data into train and test data
4,for checking accuracy after prediction it was giving error as y_test was int and y_pred was float s using numpy converted y_pred to int as trying to convert y_test to float also gave error
5,Using feature_importances_ plotted the importance of each column with the target column
6,removed unused imports
